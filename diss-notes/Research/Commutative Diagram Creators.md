# GUI Software
## Quiver
https://q.uiver.app/   
GUI, can convert to latex with tikz-cd.  
Doesn't generate from morphisms/can't convert to morphsims.

## tikzcd-editor
https://tikzcd.yichuanshen.de/  
Similar to Quiver, GUI for tikz-cd. Annoyingly similar name to tikz-cd
## General Diagram Software
These are capable of producing Commutative Diagrams, but can't convert from/to morphisms. Also unlikely to do latex.

# LaTeX
## tikz-cd
https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tikz-cd   
Generates commutative diagrams. In some sense the result isn't very human readable, but the text isn't very human readable. Good candidate for a thing to convert my input into though.


## Generating Latex Code for Commutative Diagrams
https://cs230.stanford.edu/projects_fall_2022/reports/103.pdf    
Attempting to create a model that generates TikZ code for a commutative diagram based off an image of a commutative diagram.
